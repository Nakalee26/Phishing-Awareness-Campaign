# What is phishing?

Phishing is a common scam that attempts to lure you into giving up your username, password, or other sensitive information by masquerading as someone you know and trust. This can be done by phone, but is typically done in email. The email may appear to come from ECSU or another company you do business with, and it often asks you to click a link, open an attachment, or reply with your account or personal information.<p></p>
Phishing is a type of cyber attack that leverages social engineering techniques. It manipulates you into giving away private information by impersonating a trusted person or company like a bank or colleague.
Phishing attacks can happen via email, phone calls, texts and social media. They are designed to bait you into clicking on a malicious link or opening a malicious file.
A more sophisticated type of phishing attack is known as spear fishing. This attack is targeted towards a specific person, making it more believable and effective.
